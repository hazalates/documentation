## What do I need

[inventorisation](/images/23-04-12-inventorisation/inventorisation.png)

I'm not focussing on liquids atm. So i'll need:

- Interface for control
    - LCD 
    - Button(s)
    - Speaker
    - LED indicator

- Environment control
    - Heat pad for heating
    - Fan for cooling/air circulation
    - PID for control (code)
    - Sensor for temp/humidity measurement
    - Vaporizer for humidity control

- Power
    - 12v adapter 
    - 12 to 5v converter 
    - Safety loop to avoid short circuit/danger
    - (accu?)
    - (solar panels?)

- Microcontroller (ATtiny3216)

- Programmer (SWD/FTDI)

- Communication and programming ports/protocol (UPDI/FTDI)

- Caps, resistors, MOSFET's/transistors, plugs/cables etc.

- Exterior 
    - Box 
    - Housing for interface (exterior) (LCD, buttons, speaker, LED's)
    - Housing for internal electronics (internal) (Sensor, vaporisator, microcontroller)
    - Power cord entrance
