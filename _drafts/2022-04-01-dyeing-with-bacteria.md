title: "Dyeing with bacteria"
---

Today i tagged along with the bio-hack academy to do some experiments with a color producing bacteria. 

The Janthinobacterium lividum is a dark blue bacteria. The pigment produces by this bacteria can be used to color textile. 

To try this i first needed some material to dye, so i went to the Zeeman and bought some socks, underpants, and a shirt. 

To make sort of a pattern i looked up different Shogun techniques and used rubber bands to tye the textile.

Secondly i placed the textile in a plastic bag and poured some base over the textile to feed the bacteria. We closed the bag and sterilized it by using a pressure-cooker. We want to kill most of the bacteria so our Janthino can thrive.

Lastly we inoculated the sterilized bag with the bacteria, sealed the bag with a cotton (to allow some oxygen to flow) and placed the bag in an incubator.

And now we wait. 

#### Results 

We checked every couple of days to see if the textile was turning blue. After waiting 12 days we didn't see any progress.

This was the underwear i dyed. The print is nice but not as bright as i hoped. Next time i'd add more base to feed the bacteria.
